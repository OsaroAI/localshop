Localshop Helm Chart
====================

Currently, a bug exists in this template where it always expects to be able to create a job.

This job is used to bootstrap `localshop`, update db schema, etc.
IOW, things that should only be ran by a single instance at once.

The job is used as a lock in this case.

This is fine for an install and only becomes an issue in the case of an upgrade.

**Workaround:** If you upgrade, just delete the existing job beforehand. Kudos.
